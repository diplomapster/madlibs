        <h1>Once upon a Christmas</h1>
        <p>Long ago in a magical land called Belgravia the ruler, <span class="person1"></span> found themselves all alone in their castle on Chrismas eve.
          In their sorrow they vowed, "Never again shall the rulers of Belgravia be alone on Christmas!" and passed a royal declaration,
          making it soverign law that all future rulers, upon accending the throne, would have until Christmas eve of that year to marry, or they would forefit the throne.</p>

          <p>Years later, <span class="person2"></span> Belgravia's ruler-to-be was living in New York when they got a phone call telling them their father had died.
          They were now the ruler!"<span class="exclamation"></span>" they said. "It is December 21st. I have 4 days to meet someone and get married!"</p>

          <p>Later that same evening <span class="person2"></span> was <span class="verb"></span> in central park when they had a cinematic meet-cute with the most
          amazing <span class="demonym"></span> they had ever met. "<span class="exclamation"></span>" they cried, "It is too complicated to explain but we must marry right away."</p>

          <p>And they did. Everything worked out and that Christmas <span class="person2"></span> experienced the most <span class="adjective"></span> Christmas ever.</p>

          <p>And they lived, it is to be presumed, happily ever after...
